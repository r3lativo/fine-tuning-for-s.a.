## README for Fine-Tuning Language Models

### Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the fine-tuning of various language models for different tasks. The notebooks cover the following:

* **Fine-tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis:** This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune the BERT model for sentiment classification on the Stanford IMDB reviews dataset. It covers standard fine-tuning and PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).
* **Fine-tuning Llama-3 for Text Classification:** This notebook showcases the fine-tuning of the Llama-3 model for text classification. It utilizes a custom trainer class to replace the default loss function with cross-entropy, suitable for classification tasks.
* **Fine-tuning Llama-3 for Text Generation:** This notebook explores fine-tuning the Llama-3 model for text generation using a dataset of English instructions. It combines quantization and LoRA (QLoRA) for efficient training with a minimal subset of parameters.

### Basic Concepts: Quantization and LoRA

**Quantization** is a technique that reduces the precision of model weights to save memory and computational resources. In this context, it involves converting 32-bit floating-point weights to 4-bit integers. While this reduces precision, it often has a minimal impact on model performance.

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** is a method for efficiently fine-tuning large language models. Instead of updating all model parameters, LoRA introduces low-rank matrices to specific layers. This allows for task-specific adjustments without modifying the original pre-trained weights, making it more efficient and less prone to overfitting.

**QLoRA** combines quantization and LoRA for even more efficient fine-tuning. By quantizing the model weights, QLoRA further reduces memory usage and computational cost, making it suitable for training large models on limited hardware.
